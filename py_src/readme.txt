Contains a python library for simulating the spread of disease.

The library was written in Python, however, after re-writing in c++ (for speed benefits) there is no need to keep.

Broadly speaking, the library is organised by using dataclasses and schematic models (defined inside params and config)
for added flexibility when working with different model configurations.
